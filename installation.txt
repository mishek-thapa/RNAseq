#Installation of RNAseq Programs 

# Quality control.
# Download and install FastQC into the src directory.
cd ~/src
curl -O http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/fastqc_v0.11.2.zip

# Linux people: do an: sudo apt-get install unzip
unzip fastqc_v0.11.2.zip
cd FastQC
ls -l

# There is an error in the distribution. The executable flag is not set.
chmod +x fastqc

# We want fastqc to be globally available. We have two ways to do this. We could
# add the path to the library to the main PATH (as before), but that gets old when you
# have to add every single program and reload the PATH.
# Alternatively we could add one directory say ~/bin then create links (shortcuts)
# in this directoy to the programs that we want to be available globally.

# Create the ~/bin directory
mkdir -p ~/bin

# Add the ~/bin folder into the PATH

# On a Mac:
echo 'export PATH=~/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.profile
# to apply to the current shell not just future ones:
source ~/.profile

# Under Linux do the following:
# echo 'export PATH=~/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
# source ~/.bashrc

# Link the fastqc under an "shortcut" in ~/bin
ln -s ~/src/FastQC/fastqc ~/bin/fastqc

# Test that the tool works.
# Linux people may need to install java.
# See the linux install guide: http://www.personal.psu.edu/iua1/courses/code-repository-2014.html#chromebook
fastqc -h

# Run a fastqc report on all files in the directory.
cd ~/edu/lec7
fastqc *.fastq


# Install trimmomatic
cd ~/src
curl -O http://www.usadellab.org/cms/uploads/supplementary/Trimmomatic/Trimmomatic-0.39.zip
unzip Trimmomatic-0.329.zip
cd Trimmomatic-0.39

# Alas not much is there. You got to hit the manual at:
# http://www.usadellab.org/cms/uploads/supplementary/Trimmomatic/TrimmomaticManual_V0.32.pdf
# It has a really user unfriendly way to run it. Thanks a bunch!
java -jar trimmomatic-0.39.jar

# Lets make a script that lauches that for us.
# Create a script with Komodo or from the command line that contains the following
# shown below :

# You can also do it from the command line
echo '#!/bin/bash' > ~/bin/trimmomatic
echo 'java -jar ~/src/Trimmomatic-0.39/trimmomatic-0.39.jar $@' >> ~/bin/trimmomatic
chmod +x ~/bin/trimmomatic

# Look Ma! It works.
trimmomatic



# STAR Installation is more difficult because I could not find a binary built 
# hereâ€™s there source code that has to be compiled: https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR
# I found it really annoying to install and had to mess around before I got it to work
